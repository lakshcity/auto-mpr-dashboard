1.	Share the currently uploaded APK file with the vendor team and request them to remove the new domain changes and provide an updated APK file.

In the Case module, as the number of subcategories increases, configuring dependent fields using Dependent field Visibility reaches a functional limitation and becomes difficult to maintain.

Proposed Solution:
Implement a Mashup Control that triggers case page load to hide and unhide required fields. The approach would be as follows:

Dump all relevant fields into a dedicated section on the layout.
Maintain a Master Data Mapping (MDM) that contains:
Subcategory name
List of field names that should be visible for that subcategory
On load, the mashup will:
Identify the selected subcategory on the layout
Fetch the corresponding field list from the MDM
Make all fields in the section invisible by default
Set only the fields mapped in the MDM as visible
Benefits:

Eliminates the need to repeatedly update Dependent field Visibility rules
Simplifies maintenance by moving the logic to data configuration instead of layout
Any new subcategory addition or update will only require an MDM update, not rule changes
Future Impact / Considerations:

Continued support for Mashup Controls in future platform builds
Dependency on internal field identifiers (e.g., data-autoid) remaining stable
Please let me know your thoughts or if you’d like to discuss this approach further. Sharing a video of small POC demo implemented.

 

In This video, we have chosen a field named ""Territory"" in column ""parentdataautoid"" and basis of dropdown values from column ""parentvalue"",  the fields mapped in column ""showdataautoid"" becomes Visible.

Justification :
CRMNEXT permits the use of inline resources such as:
• Inline script elements (<script>...</script>)
• JavaScript URLs (javascript: in links)
• Inline event handlers (e.g., onclick, onmouseover)
• Inline styles (style=""..."" attributes)
• The use of eval() and similar functions to execute dynamically generated JavaScript code.
While unsafe-inline and unsafe-eval weaken CSP by allowing potentially dangerous script execution, the overall risk is substantially reduced by combining:
• X-Frame-Options to prevent framing-based attacks.
• X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block (header enables browser-based protection against reflected XSS attacks by stopping page rendering when an XSS attack is detected)
• Code-level defences (input validation, output encoding, and sanitization) to neutralize malicious payloads before they are executed.
Input validation, output encoding, and sanitization are effective in mitigating XSS by ensuring that potentially malicious inputs are either rejected or rendered harmless.",KLI || Justification to take exception,

A critical vulnerability has been discovered in the AdonisJS framework’s bodyparser component, tracked as  CVE-2026-21440 (CVSS score: 9.2). The flaw allows attackers to exploit improper handling of file uploads and request parsing to perform arbitrary file writes on the server. This means a malicious actor could craft specially designed requests that bypass validation and write files to sensitive directories, potentially leading to remote code execution, privilege escalation, or full system compromise. The vulnerability affects deployments using the vulnerable bodyparser versions and poses a significant risk to applications built on AdonisJS, especially those exposed to untrusted input. Immediate remediation is required by upgrading to the patched release, applying strict file upload validation, and monitoring for suspicious file system activity. This issue highlights the importance of secure request parsing in web frameworks, as exploitation could result in severe operational and security impacts.
 
Impact 
 
The impact of the AdonisJS Bodyparser vulnerability (CVSS 9.2) is highly severe, as it allows attackers to perform arbitrary file writes on the server’s filesystem. By exploiting this flaw, a malicious actor could overwrite critical application files, drop malicious scripts, or plant backdoors, ultimately leading to remote code execution and full compromise of the affected server. This exposes organizations to risks such as data breaches, service disruption, privilege escalation, and persistence of unauthorized access. Since AdonisJS is commonly used to build production web applications, exploitation could directly affect business-critical services and sensitive user data. The vulnerability’s high CVSS score reflects its potential to cause widespread operational and security damage if not remediated promptly.
 
Recommended Action 
 
1.	Upgrade Immediately – Apply the latest patched version of AdonisJS and its bodyparser component to eliminate the flaw.
2.	Restrict File Uploads – Enforce strict validation and sanitization of file upload parameters, including file names, paths, and extensions.
3.	Use Safe Directories – Configure uploads to be stored only in controlled, non-executable directories with limited permissions.
4.	Implement Access Controls – Limit file upload functionality to trusted users and authenticated sessions to reduce exposure.
5.	Apply Defense-in-Depth – Harden servers with least-privilege principles, disable unnecessary services, and enforce OS-level protections.
6.	Conduct Security Testing – Perform regular penetration testing and code reviews to identify potential weaknesses in request parsing and file handling.
7.	Educate Developers – Train teams on secure coding practices for handling user input and file uploads to prevent similar issues

-- During implementation and testing of CSV-based integrations in CRMNEXT, we observed inconsistent behavior between:
-- PostgreSQL native import (pgAdmin4 – Import/Export functionality)
-- CRMNEXT “Read from Data Source” type of task


1. Header Name Dependency vs Position-Based Import
1.1 Observed Behavior
PostgreSQL (pgAdmin Import):
Imports CSV based on column position
Header names are ignored
CRMNEXT (Read from Data Source):
Requires exact column header name match
File is skipped even when:
Column count is correct
Column order is correct
Datatypes are compatible

1.2 Impact
Client files with different header naming conventions cannot be processed
Manual file modification is required

1.3 Clarification Required
Is position-based CSV loading supported in CRMNEXT?
If not, is this a known limitation?

1.4 Expected Behavior
Ability to load CSV files based on column position, similar to PostgreSQL COPY

1.5 Required Outcome
Configurable option:
Header-based load (current)
Position-based load (new)

2. Special Characters in Header Names
2.1 Observed Behavior
Client CSV headers contain special characters:
Example: Lead__r.Status, format(Date_of_Birth__c)

Table columns are created with exact same names
Despite this, the file is silently skipped
Removing headers allows successful processing

2.2 Impact
Client-provided files cannot be consumed without modification
No indication of failure reason

2.3 Clarification Required
Are special characters in column/header names supported?

2.4 Expected Behavior
Either:
Support special characters in headers
OR
Reject file with a clear validation error

2.5 Required Outcome
No silent skips due to special characters
Clear error or successful processing

3. Silent Skip & Missing Error Logging
3.1 Observed Behavior
In failure scenarios (header mismatch, special characters, validation issues):
File is skipped
No exception or error is logged

3.2 Impact
No operational visibility
Root cause cannot be identified

3.3 Expected Behavior
Every skipped or rejected file should:
Raise an exception
Log the exact reason for failure

3.4 Required Outcome
Mandatory error logging for all skip/failure scenarios in Read from Data Source tasks

4. Summary of Requirements
Support position-based CSV import
Define and support special characters in headers
Eliminate silent skips by enforcing error logging",READ FROM DATA SOURCE,

With all the understanding, one question is arising here which you should answer and again check in your application that how cache expiry is configured at application level. 

How it is happening that cache is not getting auto clean up after the build 91 deployed in production on 6th of Nov evening.

Before 6th it is working properly at late evening at exactly same time around 20:30 it starts clearing the cache. Something is there in your application which clears the cache or expires the cache store in redis at certain time. If we are storing something in redis cache then it should also get expire/release and that logic will be present in your application code or at caching configuration file. Request you to thoroughly check with your product and come back with update on priority.

Kindly go through below links to have more idea on redis caching ttl in detailed.

Regarding the Document Generation issue, as discussed in our previous conversation, we require detailed information to support proper tracking of the document generation process, either in the form of application logs, kibana logs or database query (SELECT) references.
We expect this information to help us gain a clear understanding of the following points:
1. The number of users performing document generation and downloading documents within a given time period.
2. The number of users whose document generation is failed, in progress, and successfully completed, including the document download status.
3. For document generation processes that are currently running, the method used to estimate the remaining processing time until completion aslo to estimate the button stop on pop-up will be appeared.
4. The maximum capacity of the document generation process.
5. The system logic or handling mechanism when the document generation process reaches its maximum capacity or encounters an error. 
     - Additionally, is there any possibility to improve or increase the maximum generation capacity?
6. The system logic whenever user click the stop button and what it will do to another geneartion process either on other device or in same device.
7. Whether the required logs or data extraction can also be obtained from the Production environment (old build).
     - If not, we would appreciate a detailed explanation as to why this information cannot be retrieved from Production, not only the reason that the Production environment is running a different version.

We believe this information will greatly assist us in analyzing the issue, improving monitoring and troubleshooting, and responding appropriately to user complaints. At this time, we do not have sufficient data to clearly explain the document generation capacity to users or to properly address the reported issues.

Thank you for your support and cooperation.",BNI | SIT| SR 386 | Document Generation Log,

The error popup alert does not appear when page validation or group validation is applied on an accordion. The validation is implemented to ensure that the user opens all accordions and reviews the information before proceeding.

To achieve this, we followed the steps below:

Added three accordions to the layout.

The first accordion is open by default, while the other two are initially closed.

We update a flag variable when the closed accordions are opened.

Based on these flag values, a group validation action is created and triggered on the Continue button, so the user can proceed only after opening all accordions.

Although the validation logic works correctly, the error popup is not displayed when the validation fails. This issue occurs only in the case of accordions. In other scenarios, such as OTP resend, the error popup appears as expected.

We need a solution for the issue where the error message popup does not appear when group validation is applied to an accordion.",The error message popup doesnot appear when we apply group validation for accordion,

Process: Validation on Total DI 

1. We observed that the validation message ""Please fill Total 
    DI"" is displayed even if Total DI % is populated. We further 
    observed that this is displayed when Parent Dealer field is 
    left blank but DI is populated. 

2. In other words, the validation message is incorrect. It will 
    confuse Users, same with what happened to Testers as we 
    initially thought this was a showstopper error. 

3. Note that DI can be 0 even if Loan Proceeds Payee or 
    Account Source is Dealer. While Total DI % is set as 
    mandatory field, it accepts 0 as a value  

4. A new field was also added, Loan Proceeds Payee. The 
    value selected in this field is also related as to when the 
    Parent Dealer is required. 

5. Tester also noted that even if Application Type is 
    REMIBURSEMENT or REFINANCING, Parent Dealer is still 
    required. Tester selected Account Source as DEALER, which 
    possibly explains it. But with the addition of new field Loan 
    Proceeds Payee, best to just link the Parent Dealer 
    requirement to this field. If Account Source is DEALER and 
    DEALER is the correct payee, then the Parent Dealer 
    requirement will be covered.  

6. Hence, update the validation message and mandatory tag 
    requirement. 

APP ID: --

EXPECTED RESULT:
Process: Validation on Total DI and Parent Dealer 

1. Update the Validation Message
      From: Please fill Total DI. 
      To: Please fill Parent Dealer. 

2. Display the validation message under these conditions 
    only - where Parent Dealer is blank but:
    [1] Loan Proceeds Payee = DEALER 
    [2] When Total DI % > 0.00% (i.e. when DI is above 0.00) 

3. Related to #2, Parent Dealer is only mandatory if any one 
    of these conditions is met: 
    [1] Loan Proceeds Payee = DEALER 
    [2] When Total DI % > 0.00% (i.e. when DI is above 0.00) 

4. Remove other mandatory tag requirement for Parent Dealer

2. Additionally, must align with the Data Entry insight card

    Update Borrower card: 
    a) In Data Entry: As a sample, when Main FA is in Proceed to 
        FDE status, the QDE Done/Update Borrower card is 
        already removed from the NBA. 
        [1] If User needs to update Borrower details, he will access 
             the Update Borrower insight card - which is in the
             Borrower Insight Card Group. 
        [2] The ""QDE Done"" is gone from the insight card name. 
             Retained is just ""Update Borrower"". 

    b) In Verification, we expect the same for consistency. Once 
        Main FA is saved in Initiate Verification, then the Initiate 
        Verification/Update Borrower card is removed from NBA. 
        But this is replaced with Update Borrower insight card

             another column to upload the proof. But during 
             discussion, BNext explained it is not possible, hence, 
             the proposed approach was to have an identifier or ID 
             (or any equivalent) for each record, and another table 
             or page (or something like that) linked to that identifier

  UAT Report Batch 03B #10 for the error message

1. Saving Loan Information for Multi-Borrower Application
    a) The first step is for the User is to save the Credit 
        Verification (globe icon) of each Borrower Record. Once 
        all are done, only then can User save Credit Verification in 
        SAT/UNSAT status. So User will reopen the Credit 
        Verification page of each Borrower again, lands on Detail 
        Page again, then click NEXT to go to the Edit Page to save 
        the SAT/UNSAT. Then click NEXT again, land on Borrower 
        List Page, select next Borrower and repeat the same steps. 
        If this sounds confusing to read - then its more confusing 
        for Users to appreciate as they will surely see this as 
        repetitive and unnecessary actions 
    b) Discussed with Nilabh how to simplify this series of User 
        actions, but he highlighted that system limitation already. 
    c) But letting go of the issue will also backfire as we are sure 
        Users will complain about this - and when this reaches 
        Management, will put the project team on the spot. Hence, 
        if this is indeed system limitation, then find an alternative 
        to lessen the confusion on the part of User so we can 
        likewise justify for allowing such workflow design. Our 
        insights are in Expected Results.

2. Moving from Credit Verification Detail Page to Edit Page 
    a) User is done saving the Credit Verification (Globe Icon) of 
        all Borrowers, and the User now needs to move to 
        Edit Page to rate SAT/UNSAT.
    b) From Borrower List Page, he selects Borrower and clicks 
        NEXT. System displays the Credit Verification Detail Page. 
        User clicks NEXT - but nothing is happening - no reaction 
        from system whatsover. 
    c) User clicks NEXT again, still no system reaction. Now User 
        clicks multiple times already out of frustration, then 
        suddenly system moves to Credit Verification Edit Page 
    d) Why did the system not move to Credit Verification Page
        after the first click?

3. Unknown Error 
    a) Done updating the Credit Verification, and is already in 
        the last Borrower. When NEXT button in Credit Verification 
        Detail Page is clicked, system displays ""Unknown Error"". 
    b) When clicked NEXT again, system displays ""Unable to 
        process your request, please try again."" And succeeding 
        clicks of NEXT button just displays this error message. 
    c) When you close the error message and re-open the Update 
        Verification insight card, you will see that Verification 
        Type already moved to Residence/Employment/Business. 
    d) See Issue Screenshot 

3. Display of Borrower List Page for Multi-Borrower 
    Application when Moving to Next Verification Type 
    a) Following the normal sequence of how they assess 
        accounts, User completed the CREDIT of PB first, then CB, 
        then SP. 
    b) Tester selected PB first, completed the required actions 
        in Credit Verification Page, then clicked NEXT. Tester is 
        redirected back to Borrower List Page where she chooses 
        the next Borrower. 
    c) Tester selected CB next, completed the required actions 
        in Credit Verification Page, then clicked NEXT. Tester is 
        redirected back to Borrower List Page where she chooses 
        the next Borrower. 
    d) Tester selected SP last, completed the required actions 
        in Credit Verification Page, then clicked NEXT. Tester is 
        directed to the Residence Verification Page already 
        instead of Borrower List Page

    a) Datamart Name Screening - test account lifted from 
        Datamart 
    b) Application Name Screening - file check output in LOS 

2. Background: 
    a) During initial test, Ali modified the Name Screening logic 
        because we were not hitting the record. 
    b) When it was fixed, we saw name screening results where 
        name has variation vs Application. This was as expected. 
        And is our basis also in excuting the intended scenario of 
        encoding Application name that is slightly different from 
        Datamart Name Screening name. 

3. Test Scenario: Slightly modified the name - but is still 
    expected to hit given the Match % design

3. Remove the validation when being updated is Dealer Code 
    and Accreditation Status. As Dealer Code gets updated right 
    after approval, the bigger issue is Accreditation Status

4. Having such validation means: 
   a) User needs to amend Expiry Date first, even if the 
       intention is to actually disaccredit an expired dealer. 
       Amending the Expiry Date will lose the audit trail 
       supporting the disacreditation of the Dealer 
   b) Disaccreditation is also used to watchlist or blacklist a 
       Dealer. Doing so should not require User to modify the 
       Expiry Date. Must preserve the original data.
  c) Continuing or discontinuing business with an Expired Dealer 
      is a management decision. Hence, we must preserve the 
      original Expiry Date (unless we have clearance to update), 
      esp this becomes material during management reporting.

    Report Batch 08A #21, we assume that the issues raised in 
    Edit Page are also exisitng in Detail Page 

2. Maiden Name. Should have a field where Maiden Name is     
    displayed. Make it static in the page so the other fields will 
    not move in case without Maiden Name

3. Remove / hide the fields enumerated below as they are not 
    required. Unless BNext informs us otherwise 
    [1] Civil Status                    [4] Mobile Number
    [2] Complete Address          [5] Contact Number

4. If you copied the approach in Auto Application where only 
    Related Party highlights are shown in the Detail Page, and 
    need to click the hyperlinked Related Party ID to view the 
    full page, then follow the field placement in Expected 
    Results as this accounted for the removal of the fields 
    mentioned above (which is possibly existing currently) 

5. And if indeed you copied the approach in Auto Application, 
    then consider merging also the Indiv and Non-Indiv Related 
    Parties in one object, where the data highlights are as 
    enumerated below and follows this order:
    [1] Related Party ID 
    [2] Related Party Type 
    [3] Related Party Name - if Indiv, name is concatenated to 
         include the Suffix

When translator action is saved first time - correct field mapping gets stored. When translator action is edited for changes then field mapping gets removed automatically and default value as False gets reset under mapping. This is resulting into misbehaving trigger action function. Wrong value is getting passed to EDS.

3. Add new Translator Action -> Select required EDS -> Select fields mapping with Check Type (Type =10) under input param mapping.

1. As agreed and as expected, there should be validation that 
    will restrict the Application from being updated to next 
    status if any of the system-computed field did not compute 

2. But in Apps 181990 and 181704, the EY was 0 and it reached 
    Pre-Booking stage. These applications have EYs now, either 
    it was manually maintained backend so the booking can 
    proceed or it was resolved at the time of reporting. 

3. Testers also observed fields below are not auto-computed 
    when they are changing values while in Unit Edit Page
    a) Total Tuck-Ins 
    b) Other Deferred Credit Interest

4. Additionally, since EIR (or Annual EIR - as explained in Excel 
    UAT Report Batch E - #148, #149, #158) is not yet in place, 
    we cannot test if the validation will fire in case system-
    computation does not work.

5. Reporting as defect to ensure that the fix applied is 
    permanent and that it will cover EIR computation also. This 
    is also to remind that validation should be in place where 
    Application is restricted from moving forward if any system-
    computation failed to work.

    a) Our understanding was this was developed to make

        Proceed to FDE and FDE Done, the mandatory fields are 
        in place regardless if Fill Data Manually is YES or NO

Related Party File Check  

1. Applicable File Checks to Related Parties depends on 
    Effective Share or Relationship Type. 

2. If a certain File Check is not applicable to the Related Party, 
    approach used by BNext is to retain the PENDING tag. 

3. Please understand that on a User standpoint, this gives the 
    impression that File Check is still running. 

4. Procedurally, will also define PENDING as -- awaiting BAP 
    Response. Giving them 2 definition - awaiting BAP response 
    or non-credit Related Party is operationally inefficient. Under 
    the latter, we have to create another manual step for User 
    to validate if its PENDING because file check criteria not met

5. On UAT standpoint, the PENDING is also misleading - because 
    we need to ask BNEXT everytime if the PENDING means its 
    not applicable or if its REAL pending - like if system made an 
    error and it triggered a file check request.

Expected Result:
Process: Related Party File Check

1. If File Check on Related Party is not applicable, display a file 
    check output of N/APP or any equivalent that will 
    immediately inform User that its not applicable 

2. Do not use PENDING as status to describe that file check is 
    not applicable. Pending should only refer to one thing -

As this is originally logged in excel, the space is not enough. Hence if you are reading from the Case Portal, you will receive the issues under different case numbers.

1. We observed that display of insight cards have been 
    changing. After the initial fix as agreed with Deep, it has 
    been the same for a considerable time - with patches 
    deployed during this time. And even thanked the team for 
    the fix as it made the User journey more organized and 
    consistent as it stayed that way - until it wasn't anymore
2. In recent patches, we saw the insight cards changing 
    sequence. On best effort, will paste screenshots of old 
    insight card sequence for reference - see Issue Screenshot. 
    But alternatively, please consider checking older versions of 
    LOS MVP2 (prior the recent patches, if that is possible) to 
    check the previous insight card sequence or pls discuss with 
    Deep as he successfuly handled this before

The regex validation applied to a custom field is not functioning as expected.
Despite configuring the regex to allow only numeric values, the field is still accepting non-numeric characters.

Expected Behavior
The custom field should accept only numeric values (0–9) and restrict any alphabetic or special characters as per the applied regex.

Actual Behavior
The field accepts non-numeric input even after applying the numeric-only regex.

Steps to Reproduce
Navigate to the Event object.
From the Toolbox, go to Customize Page Layout.
Open the New/Edit page of the Appointment layout.
Observe that a regex is applied to the Mobile Number field.
Click on the Add button to create a new appointment.
Enter alphabetic characters in the Mobile Number field.

Field: Car Brand 

This is related to Excel UAT Report Batch C #97 

1. As agreed with Deep during Data Entry sign-off, we will 
    revisit MVP1 fields where BNext used dropdown approach 
    instead of search. This is noting the following: 
    a) We dont need all dropdown fields to be converted to 
        search. Just a few fields with very long LOV 
    b) BNext will explain if can handle. Or if not, what is the 
        difficulty

2. Main Issue: Zooming in on fields with long LOV, why some 
    are using search approach (which is the better option), 
    others are using dropdown. 

3. The Car Brand field should also utilize Search approach. 
    Currently it is not arranged alphabetically; hence User needs 
    to scroll down and read each LOV to find the required value. 
    But changing from dropdown to search field should retain 
    its current features where Brand LOVs displayed is dependent 
    on Loan Type 

APP ID: --

EXPECTED RESULT:
Field: Car Brand
Record: Unit (Edit Page)

1. Convert the Car Brand field from Dropdown to Search but 
    should retain its current features where Brand LOVs displayed 
    is dependent on Loan Type (e.g. if Loan Type = TRUCK, 
    displays only car brands under TRUCK)

Field: Downpayment % and PHP

1. Downpayment % should not carry a default 0 value. As this 
    is a system-computed field, it should carry value dependent 
    on Net Unit Price and Downpayment PHP 

2. We generally observe that Downpayment % is blank. But an    
    LA Tester reported that Downpayment % has 0 value despite 
    Downpayment PHP being blank. See Issue Screenshot for    
    reference 
     *If you are reading this from Case Portal and image is not 
      uploaded, then refer to Excel UAT Report-Batch E, #175

3. For us this means: 
    a) System-computation did not work 
    b) Downpayment %, for some reason or maybe DB exception 
        as you may call it, carried default 0.00 value

3. We dont know if the issue is a bug that BNext can still 
    resolve or not, as we somehow anticipate you will say you 
    cannot replicate the issue noting we also observe that 
    Downpayment % is initially blank. But the main concern 
    here is to ensure system-computation works and mandatory 
    validation runs properly. This is coming from Audit issues 
    where failures in mandatory tag validation even for one 
    account has been deemed as weak input control already. 
    Audit only does sampling - so their evaluation is if it 
    happened on one unit, then it may have happened to other 
    units that were not part of the sampled accounts

4. Currently, only Downpayment % is set as mandatory, which 
    followed MPI Field List

EXPECTED RESULT:

This is related to Excel UAT Report-Batch E, #174 which explained that Downpayment % must properly carry the feature of being a system-computed field

1. Set Downpayment PHP as a mandatory field (with red 
    asterisk)

2. Related to issue raised in Excel UAT Report Batch E #166 
    (if you are reading from Case Portal, dont know the Case ID 
    for this, hence just refer to the excel file), there should be a 
    consistent design when updating Unit #1 and its impact to 
    additional units - whether Unit Data Transfer is initiated or 
    not. Please refer to the related case to understand better as 
    we provided a sample there. We cannot have different 
    behaviors for different fields under different scenarios as 
    that will be difficult for User to follow and remember 
    operationally.

    years that are not acceptable in the field Year First Reg. If 
    the intention is to introduce input control, we agree to the 
    intention but not on the approach. Should be maintained as 
    an input field (similar with Year Model where User encodes 
    the year) but handle the control by setting upper and lower

2. Display the ""Invalid Date"" validation when User encodes 
    unacceptable values (e.g. inputs MMDDYYY, letters, etc.) 

3. Apply input control where: 
    a) Year Today = represents the Current Year (NOT the 
        Application Year but the Current Year)
    b) Upper Limit = Current Year. Means User can input as max 
        YYYY is the Current Year, cannot input a future year (e.g.
        if Current Year is 2026, can only input 2026 and not 2027)
    c) Lower Limit = Current Year - 30. With Admin provision 
        to change the ""30"" to a lower or higher number.

2. If Multiple Unit, we observed the different auto-copy 
    behavior of dynamic fields in Application Details. 
    a) Sample 1: Truck Weight. Unit #1 is changed, the new 
        Truck Weight is auto-copied in all Additional Units,  
        observed in units where Data Copy was previously 
        triggered and not triggered. User can then modify the 
        value in the Additional Unit 

    b) Sample 2: Year First Reg, Unit #1 is changed, the new 
        Year First Reg is NOT auto-copied in Additional Units, 
        observed in units where Data Copy was previously 
        triggered and not triggered  

3. This is unacceptable as there should be one design only for 
    consistent procedural steps. It will confuse User if we have 
    different instructions for different fields under different 
    scenarios

    a) As indicated in sign-off document: 
        [1] If fields will be in one page column, display order of

        [2] If fields will be in two page columns, follow the field

    b) For employment fields - follow MPI layout 
    c) For employment address fields - follow MPI layout. For 
        reference, you may check Additional SOI-Business as it 
        follows the correct Address layout (except that the field

Field: Zip Code  

1. Unlike REGION which is disabled and auto-populated based 
    on BARANGAY, CITY, and PROVINCE, even in MVP1 we have 
    already questioned the approach used in ZIP CODE  

2. We understand the Address follows a hierarchy. But same 
    with REGION, ZIP CODE is also unique. There can be no 2 ZIP 
    CODE for one Barangay-City-Province data set.

3. But currently, User still needs to select the ZIP CODE even if 
    there's always just one value. This is being compared with 
    GDS where ZIP CODE is auto-populated the moment 
    Barangay-City-Province is populated 

4. Bottomline, we expect it is same as REGION where field is 
    disabled and auto-populated based on Barangay-City-Province.

Layout: Residence - Additional Address (Edit Page) 

1. In Additional Residence Address, did not follow the required 
    field placement and layout 

2. We designed additional address to be in a tabular form. But 
    BNext approach is Data Object Bank (unsure if this is the 
    correct name). 
    a) This is not preferred because when saved in Edit Page, 
        the data is in vertical form instead of horizontal. It is 
        inconvenient to User. 
    b) The data is just in one column, so it extends the page 
    c) As it is, address fields are also not in proper order. But 
        will no longer be highlighted in Expected Results since we 
        prefer the tabular approach as noted below. 

3. Revert to the original requirement. You can create 2 
    +ADD NEW buttons - one for PH and one for non-PH address, 
    which is same with our wireframe. With validation that can 
    only encode max 3 additional residence address 
    (combined PH and non-PH) 

4. The table approach which was the original design in both 
    wireframes created by BNext and MPI was perfectly okay

1. It was observed in Contact Number that:

        delete it. But once saved or once it has been updated to 
        next status code, it cannot be deleted it anymore 

2. Since BNext can put this kind of control, then the control 
    should be when the Borrower is saved in Initiate Verification 
    as that concludes the Data Entry part 

3. But while in Data Entry, given its name is Data Entry which 
    means application is still at the stage where data is being 
    completed, then he should have the provision to add, edit, 
    delete - and that happens in the whole Data Entry stage

Additional Employment / Business Address (Indiv-Edit) 

1. In Additional Employment/Business Address, did not follow 
    the required field placement and layout 

2. We designed additional address to be in a tabular form. But 
    BNext approach is Data Object Bank (unsure if this is the 
    correct name). 
    a) This is not preferred because when saved in Edit Page, 
        the data is in vertical form instead of horizontal. It is 
        inconvenient to User. 
    b) The data is just in one column, so it extends the page 
    c) As it is, address fields are also not in proper order. But 
        will no longer be highlighted in Expected Results since we 
        prefer the tabular approach as noted below. 

3. Revert to the original requirement. You can create 2 
    +ADD NEW buttons - one for PH and one for non-PH address, 
    which is same with our wireframe. With validation that can 
    only encode max 3 additional employment/business address 
    (combined PH and non-PH) 

4. The table approach which was the original design in both 
    wireframes created by BNext and MPI was perfectly okay

    changing. After the initial fix as agreed with Deep, it has 
    been the same for a considerable time - with patches 
    deployed during this time. And even thanked the team for 
    the fix as it made the User journey more organized and 
    consistent as it stayed that way - until it wasn't anymore
2. In recent patches, we saw the insight cards changing 
    sequence. On best effort, will paste screenshots of old 
    insight card sequence for reference - see Issue Screenshot. 
    But alternatively, please consider checking older versions of

Process: Creation of Multiple Unit Records - Part 1
As this is originally logged in excel, the space is not enough. Hence if you are reading from the Case Portal, you will receive the issues under different case numbers.

1. BNext successfully developed the preferred approach of 
    automatically creating multiple unit records via the field 
    Number of Units. 

2. These are the observations and insights: 
    a) The Number of Units field is only present when adding a 
        Unit. It is hidden once the Unit Record is created 
    b) When Number of Units is used, it creates multiple Unit 
        Records equivalent to the value indicated in Number of 
        Units. Sample, if Number of Units = 2, system will create 2 
        Unit Records upon saving 
    c) In Main FA - Unit Details section, the additional unit 
        contains the same Vehicle Details with that of first unit. 
    d) But in Unit Record (Edit and Detail) of additional unit, 
        all fields are blank - including the Vehicle Details section 

APP ID: 182316

EXPECTED RESULT:
Process: Creation of Multiple Unit Records - Part 1 

1. When Number of Units is filled, the created Unit Records 
    must contain all the same Unit Details: 
    [1] Application Details 
    [2] Vehicle Details 
    [3] Loan Details 
    [4] Application Status - specifically the Remarks, if any

2. Confirm that the Number of Units field is intentionally 
    hidden once Unit Record is created. It is only displayed in 
    the Add Unit page.                               

3. Apply the auto-copy in Unit Record Edit and Detail Page 
    of all created Unit Records via the Number of Units field",UNIT RECORD | Process: Number of Units Part 1,

Layout: Accounts and References (Edit) 

1. Accounts and Referneces did not follow the required field 
    placement and layout 

2. We designed Accounts and References to be in a tabular 
    form. But BNext approach is Data Object Bank (unsure if this 
    is the correct name). 
    a) This is not preferred because when saved in Edit Page, 
        the data is in vertical form instead of horizontal. It is 
        inconvenient to User. 
    b) The data is just in one column, so it extends the page. If 
         User adds multiple Accounts and References, and it will 
         be in some accounts esp Non-Indiv and Truck accounts 
         where Borrowers are Self-Employed, it will be a very 
         long page. It is inconvenient esp if User needs to edit. 
    c) Right now you may have less appreciation of User 
        experience because testing-wise, you only add 1 or 2. 
        But in real applications, Accounts alone can run to 10 or 
        more esp fleet clients like logistics companies. Add 
        References which can be 5 or more - imagine how long 
        the page will be

3. Revert to the original requirement, use table approach.

        if encoded in earlier status code and updated in later 
        status code. Sample, encoded in QDED, then it can be 
        deleted in QDED, PFDE, or FDED status    
    d) Lookout: Under tabular form, ensure that mandatory fields 
        are tagged accordingly (with *)

This is first reported in Excel UAT Report Batch A #46, still 
unresolved as of writing of this issue

1. As required, for tabs that are not yet applicable in the status 
    code - should contain blank pages only 
    a) The initial requirement was to hide the tabs - this covers 
        both Indiv and Non-Indiv Borrower 
    b) But per BNEXT team, cannot hide the tabs. But can make 
        it blank. Hence, sign-off document included the pages
        expected to be blank.

2. But, for instance, in App 176513, there is a clickable Unit ID 
    in Disbursement Tab which we cannot understand the 
    purpose. This confusion for displaying objects prematurely 
    is the main reason for our requirement to hide the objects 
    when not yet applicable. This attracts unncessary queries 
    from Reviewers and Auditors.

3. There are also layout concerns, but is useless to be discussed 
    here since they should not have been issues in Data Entry in 
    the first place, as they are not yet applicable

This is related to issue in Excel UAT Report Batch D #130 (still unresolved as of writing) where we cannot fetch Referror details 

1. Because we cannot test the Referror Fetching, we also 
    cannot test if the fetched Referror can be deleted or

    a) Changing Actual Referror 
    b) Changing the Account Source from Branch to another

    Branch to another value will automatically remove the 
    previously fetched and selected actual Referror Name

As this is originally logged in excel, the space is not enough. Hence if you are reading from the Case Portal, you will receive the issues under different case numbers.

1. The EIR field is missing in both Edit and Detail Page. This was 
    discussed previously with Deep (and cant recall if with Ali,
    Akash and/or Nilabh as well). Subsequent to that discussion,
    we shared Loan Computations v4 which consolidated the 
    loan values computations - including EIR (same in MVP1) 

2. To refresh - EIR was an MVP1 requirement. In the EIR 
    calculator, 2 kinds of EIR are MONTHLY and ANNUALLY: 
    a) In MVP1, BNext developed the MONTHLY EIR and labelled 
        it IRR. But business requirement is the ANNUAL EIR. 
    b) This was the gap in MVP1 as the wrong type of EIR was 
        computed and displayed. But this was not a showstopper 
        then, hence the correction was moved to MVP2. Notably, 
        the Monthly EIR (or IRR in LOS) is not entirely useless 
        because it contains variable to arrive at the Annual EIR.

Process: Referror Name for Multi-Unit Application 

This is related to issues raised in Excel UAT Report Batch D #130 and Excel UAT Report Batch E #160 where we cannot successfully fetch Actual Referror Name 

1. Because of the error, we cannot also test for multiple unit 
    application

2. Highlighting this issue so BNext can validate that the 
    expected features should be working in UAT before we 
    retest. Earlier issues may be checked on first or single unit

EXPECTED RESULT:

1. Prerequsite: Fix the API issue (or whatever issue it is) that 
    causes the error in fetching Referror Name. This is as 
    indicated in the Excel UAT Reports mentioned under Issue 
    Details

2. User can delete or unselect the previously fetched and 
    selected Actual Referror Name. 
    a) For Unit #1, this is to handle:  
        [1] Changing Actual Referror 
        [2] Changing Account Source from BRANCH to another 
             value
    b) For Additional Units, this is to handle changing Actual 
        Referror Name only (as Account Source is non-editable 
        for additional units)

3. System will automatically reflect the updates once saved: 
    a) Display the new selected Actual Referror under Unit #1 
        and/or Additional Units, whichever was updated 
    b) If Account Source of Unit #1 changed from BRANCH to 
        another value, all these should apply to Unit #1 and 
        Additional Units:
        [1] Reset the field Actual Referror Name (i.e. becomes 
             blank)

Field: Net Monthly Installment 

1. NMI is automatically rounding up by 1.00 even if the actual 
    system-computed NMI has .00 decimal points. You can 
    validate this in MVP1 as this caused major issues in 
    Production. We recall this being handled during UAT but 
    during cutover, it reverted to the wrong value logic 

2. Final NMI follows this logic - if initial/raw computation has: 
    a) Decimal points of .00, the NMI is NOT rounded up 
    b) Decimal ponts of .01 to .09, NMI is automatically rounded 
        up by 1.00 

3. Sample: 
    a) Refer to Issue Screenshot for an actual account in LOS.  
        if you are reading this from Case Portal and image is not 
        uploaded, refer to Excel UAT Report-Batch E, #182 
        [1] NMI in LOS is ?112,001.00 
        [2] NMI in Excel Calculator is ?112,000.00 
        [3] This is due to the rounding up as explained in #3 
             above. The correct value should be ?112,000.00 
        [4] As a result of wrong NMI, other related fields in LOS 
             also with incorrect values because NMI is a variable: 
             Prompt Payment Discount, Gross Monthly Installment, 
             PN Amount, Total Interest, Other Deferred Credit 
             Interest, and IRR (to be renamed Monthly EIR)
    b) To illustrate further: 
        [1] Initially Computed NMI = ?35,000.00 
             Final NMI = ?35,000.00 
        [2] Initially Computed NMI = ?35,000.01 
             Final NMI = ?35,001.00 
        [3] Initially Computed NMI = ?35,000.99

1. Update the logic for Final NMI. Follow sample illustration

    b) Computed NMI with decimal ponts of .01 to .09, NMI is

Process: Completing Credit Verification - Part 1
As this is originally logged in excel, the space is not enough. Hence if you are reading from the Case Portal, you will receive the issues under different case numbers.

1. An update in the Credit Verification approach is: 
    a) Display first the Credit Verification Detail Page, where 
        the Loan Info hyperlink is available (globe icon). 
    b) Intended User action is to open and save Loan Info before 
        moving to the Credit Verification Edit Page where User 
        can perform other credit verification actions - including 
        updating the Verification Status 

2. Tester Action: 
    a) While in the Credit Verification Detail Page, Tester did  
        not open and save the Loan Info page. 
    b) But when ""Next"" button was clicked, still moved to the 
        Credit Verification Edit Page 

3. Issue: This is a system design weak point as it is prone to User 
    oversight. User should not be able to move to next page 
    until the Loan Info page. 

AppID: 181835

Expected Result:
Process: Completing Credit Verification (Part 1) 

1. Introduce system control when completing the first part of 
    Credit Verification. 
2. From the Update Verification insight card, when User is 
    directed to the Credit Verification Detail Page:
    a) Hide the Next button. To display it, User must open the 
        Loan Information page and save it 
    b) Default hide the button everytime User opens the Credit 
        Verification through Update Verification insight card 
        [1] It has been observed that in the case of multiple 
             Borrowers, User will be able to open and re-open the 
             credit verification page as long as not all Borrowers 
             have been updated.  
        [2] This is okay, but should force the User to re-save Loan 
             Info to ensure changes are captured 
3. If BNext has a better approach, please discuss with MPI. But 
    such solution should restrict User from moving ahead unless 
    Loan Info page is saved.

Field: Vehicle Usage 

1. We observed that once Vehicle Usage is selected and saved, 
    the next time User intends to update Vehicle Usage, User 
    needs to reselect the value in Vehicle Condition first. 

2. To replicate, do the following as a sample: 
    a) Application Details: 
        [1] Loan Type = AUTO 
        [2] Vehicle Condition = NEW 
        [3] Vehicle Usage = PRIVATE USE
    b) Save the Unit. Then navigate back to the Unit Edit Page, 
        and click the Vehicle Usage field 
    c) The only option available is PRIVATE USE. See Issue

        *If you are reading this from Case Portal and image is not 
         uploaded, then refer to Excel UAT Report-Batch E, #169
    d) Click the Vehicle Condition field, choose ""Select"", then 
        choose ""NEW"" 
    e) The Vehicle Usage field will reset. Click it, will now 
       display all the applicable LOVs 

3. This step is unnecessary and will confuse User. They will 
    initially think its a system error. As what happened to Testers 
    as they rated this as failed because they couldn't select 
    another value

EXPECTED RESULT:

Field: Downpayment 

1. As per MPI Field List, Downpayment % and Downpayment 
    PHP must both be user-inputted and system-computed. This 
    feature is existing in GDS and we required to be maintained 
    in BNext LOS. Through technical inputs from MPI IT Team, 
    we shared / emailed how it can be handled 

2. But it was later shared that BNext cannot replicate the GDS 
    feature - each field can only carry one feature, either 
    system-computed or user-inputted. With these as the only 
    options, the preference is to maintain current Downpayment 
    features: 
    a) Downpayment % - system-computed 
    b) Downpayment PHP - user-inputted 

3. But this is logged as an UAT issue to highlight that this is one 
    of the requirements which yielded failed test. Functionally 
    speaking, we cannot argue if the requirement is indeed 
    technically impossible noting we are using it in GDS. Hence, 
    our request is to explain this to the MPI IT team as they are in 
    best position to understand the difficulty.

Field: Doc Stamps Tax 

1. As per Loan Computations v4, the Doc Stamps Tax is 
    rounding off on decimal points. But in LOS, its rounding off 
    on place value ""units"". 

2. When we were discussing this with Deep, we presented these 
    rounding off rules, which follows the default or standard 
    rounding off design in excel.
    a) 10.001 to 10.004 = 10.00 
    b) 10.005 to 10.009 = 10.01

3. In UAT, we observed that Doc Stamps Tax is following the 
    rounding off rules for Net Monthly installment, where 
    decimal points .01 to .99 are automatically rounded up to 
    1.00 - as illustrated below. But it should be as explained in 
    #2 above
    a) Excel Calculator Loan Computations v4 = 12,941.25 
    b) LOS = 12,942.00

Additional Business Address (Indiv-Edit) 

1. In Additional Business Address, did not follow the required 
    field placement and layout 

2. We designed additional address to be in a tabular form. But 
    BNext approach is Data Object Bank (unsure if this is the 
    correct name). 
    a) This is not preferred because when saved in Edit Page, 
        the data is in vertical form instead of horizontal. It is 
        inconvenient to User. 
    b) The data is just in one column, so it extends the page 
    c) As it is, address fields are also not in proper order. But 
        will no longer be highlighted in Expected Results since we 
        prefer the tabular approach as noted below. 

3. Revert to the original requirement. You can create 2 
    +ADD NEW buttons - one for PH and one for non-PH address, 
    which is same with our wireframe. With validation that can 
    only encode max 3 additional business address (combined PH 
    and non-PH) 

4. The table approach which was the original design in both 
    wireframes created by BNext and MPI was perfectly okay

        Sample, if additional address was encoded in QDED, then 
        it can be deleted in QDED, PFDE, or FDED status    
    b) Have 2 add buttons - one for PH and non-PH 
    c) With validation that can only encode max 3 additional

Layout: Additional SOI-Business (Edit Page) - Part 1
For Non-Individual Borrower 

This is related to Excel UAT Report Batch F #202-204 which were about Indiv Borrower - Self-Employed and Informal Self-Employed 

1. The Additional SOI did not follow the MPI wireframe 
    a) As indicated in sign-off document: 
        [1] If fields will be in one page column, display order of 
             fields must follow the latest MPI wireframe
        [2] If fields will be in two page columns, follow the field 
             placement in the Detail Page (latest MPI wireframe), 
             since this page organizes fields in two columns. 
    b) We observed that the Additional SOI-Business has been 
        mixed up between Indiv and Non-Indiv. There has to be 
        unique Additional SOI-Business pages for Indiv and 
        Non-Indiv. Because of unique fields under each Borrower 
        Type, field misplacement will naturally happen if we force 
        them to share same page 
    c) There had been new fields added in the page which also 
        contributed to the overall field misplacement
    d) The address fields are in correct field placement. The 
         business fields are not. 

2. Place the fields according to MPI wireframe. Please 
    understand this follows the encoding structure of Originators 
    based on their interview guide.

    a) It has been increasingly inconvenient to navigate the 
        tables because the scroll bar is not permanently displayed.  
    b) Unlike MVP1, we have more tables now in MVP2. But the 
        Testers feel they are playing hide and seek with the

        can move their view to the left or right

Last Monday, we initiated the first batch of retagging by loading 411 BBNs (from RBS to BBS) via the bulk upload facility. However, during the process, we encountered an error within the CRM facility that resulted in the failure of the transfer.
The issue has already been escalated to the CRM team, and an Ivanti ticket (No. 343794) has been formally logged for their investigation. Based on the initial assessment, the issue is isolated to BBNs moving to BBS and WBS only. The root cause is still under review by the CRM team, they're already in coordination with vendor and ITG.
To further validate the scope of the issue, we have tested 5 BBNs going to RBS, and no issues were encountered during the process.

In the interim, we have temporarily paused all retagging activities going to BBS and WBS to prevent further issues while the investigation and resolution are ongoing.
Given that transfers to RBS are currently not impacted, we would like to seek the confirmation of the stakeholders on how to proceed:
-Should we continue processing BBNs going to RBS, or
-Should we wait for the CRM fix and retag the entire universe in one go once the issue has been fully resolved?

Please let us know your preference. We'll keep the group informed and provide updates as soon as more information becomes available.",A new error has been encountered during the processing via Bulk Business & Client Segment updates.,

Problem Statement (RCA):  
Login fails due to a CAPTCHA validation error despite correct input. Users are unable to log in because the application rejects the CAPTCHA response. Even when the encoded CAPTCHA value matches the displayed value, the system prevents authentication.

We currently have a workaround for this issue (please see attached file). However, the workaround is only a temporary measure. We kindly request that you review this and provide us with a permanent fix to ensure system stability and user accessibility.

Impact:
- Operational Disruption – Users cannot log in to perform CRM functions such as managing customer data and tracking leads.
- Productivity Loss – Users are spending additional time attempting to log in or escalating the issue, reducing overall efficiency.
- Possible Customer Service Delays – Inability to access CRM may lead to delayed responses to customer inquiries.
- Escalation Risk – Continued login failures may result in increased ticket volume and potential dissatisfaction among end users.


Request:  
Given the recurring nature of this issue and its direct impact on business operations, we urgently request a permanent resolution to prevent further disruptions and ensure seamless user access moving forward. Timely action will help restore user confidence and reduce the growing backlog of support tickets.",Request for Permanent Fix – CAPTCHA Validation Error,

This message needs to be slightly change as below:

""Note : On slower internet connections, import of 2000 records is supported at a time. If your csv/txt file contains more than 2000 records, split your file into smaller files and import them separately.""

As, while importing more than 2000 records, system keeps on loading and process gets terminated. Hence, want to alter the message as above


Use Case:
 - On UI it is mentioned that user can upload upto 5000 records at a time for bulk update through import functionality.
 - However, when trying to upload more than 2000 records, the system loading and post 20 mins process gets terminated.
 - Hence to maintain the consistency, we need to change the count on UI from 5000 to 2000",RBI | Request to change message on UI while Import,

This indicates that while the SSC workflow processes the request, the information is not successfully cascaded or synchronized to CRM 360.
Business Impact:  Expected SSC behavior is not working as designed, resulting in inaccurate or incomplete customer information in CRM 360.
Delays in processing client requests, leading to customer dissatisfaction and potential complaints.
Rework is required, as the team needs to file a new request to correct or update the information, increasing operational workload and turnaround time.

The value appears to be populated successfully in the UI.

However, when the user clicks Next, an error is thrown.

On further analysis, it seems the value is not actually getting mapped to the keypair field internally.

Observations :

If the same value is manually selected in the keypair field, the flow works correctly.

The same JavaScript logic works without any issue when the target field is a normal text-type field.

JavaScript Used : 
saveToCRMField('cust_7541', passed ? 'Success' : 'Failed');

Analysis / Expectation:

Based on the above behavior, it appears that saveToCRMField is not correctly binding or persisting values when used with keypair-type fields, even though the UI reflects the value.

We are encountering an issue in production related to the case history. Specifically, the AssignedTo column is being updated incorrectly. Here’s the scenario:

A case is created and initially assigned to person A.

The case is processed by A.

Later, person A is deleted from the system.

After this deletion, the case gets reassigned to person B.

However, in the case history, every time the case is closed or updated, the AssignedTo column incorrectly shows B instead of retaining the original assignments (i.e., it should reflect A first, then B).

In short, the history should record that the case was assigned to A initially, and then to B—but currently, it only shows B throughout.",KLI || User History Issue,

We have identified an issue in the stored procedure used for the report “Escalated Complaint – All SRs Report.”
In the SELECT statement, the column cas_ex12_138 (IO Referral Amount Paid) is being converted to DECIMAL(10,2). However, in the underlying table cas_ex12, the same column is defined as DECIMAL(38,6).
Because of this mismatch, the report fails with a conversion overflow error whenever the value exceeds the limit of DECIMAL(10,2) (i.e., when the number has more than 10 digits).
Requesting you to please check feasible option to alter SP to use a higher precision (for example DECIMAL(38,6) or DECIMAL(38,2)) to prevent the report execution from breaking.

Thanks.

Whenever a custom field is migrated, the associated Case flow breaks.

As a temporary workaround, the flow starts working again only after:

Randomly selecting one of the recently migrated custom fields

Editing it and saving it again (without any actual change)

Problem with the workaround:

This is not deterministic — there is no clear indication of which field needs to be edited.

In real scenarios, multiple custom fields are migrated at once.

Editing and saving each migrated field manually is not scalable or feasible.

The client has reported that this issue occurs multiple times at random, making it operationally risky.

Impact:

Case processing is disrupted unpredictably.

Requires repeated manual intervention post-migration.

Creates uncertainty and impacts client confidence in migrations.

Expectation / Ask:

The Case flow should automatically recognize and bind migrated custom fields without requiring manual edit-save actions.

Product team’s help is needed to identify:

Why flows are not re-binding after migration

Whether a post-migration refresh / recompile / sync is missing

Upon further investigation of the pod events and logs, we found that the pods were not being scheduled on any nodes due to resource shortages. To mitigate this, we increased the node count in the ASG. Despite the additional nodes, the pods continued to remain in the Pending state.
A deeper analysis indicates that the issue is related to volume mounts. Scheduler logs highlight a volume node affinity conflict, meaning the Persistent Volumes associated with these pods are restricted to specific nodes.

CRM Issue Details:  CRM Sales Performance Dashboard for AH

Issue 1: We noticed that the report is not tallied to the graph. For example, Branch San Pablo has 61 accounts opened in the graph but in the report, it shows 221 for Business Plus alone. Discrepancy is not only for branch San Pablo. 

Issue 2: On the Offers Callout Target dashlet, the numbers show 970 touched over 9108 targets but in the Offers Call Out Monitoring graph, it shows 100% of leads are untouched. 

Business Impact:  Discrepancy on the report and data make the dashboard inefficient to use.

This is with reference to the RBL Bank production database performance findings related to the GB8 application. Recently, we identified the Top 10 CPU-intensive database queries (shared in the email trail) which were experiencing high execution time. Due to this, we also observed intermittent restarts of one of the Businessnext-App pods caused by high memory consumption.

Upon analysing the execution plans for these CPU-intensive queries, we noticed that 2 indexes are reported as missing in the execution plans.

We request you to please align someone from your team to re-verify these execution plans and advise whether we can proceed with creating these 2 missing indexes on the RBL GB8 production database. Additionally, your guidance on any further possible query tuning would be highly appreciated.

Please let us know if any additional details are required from our side.",RBL GB8 Production DB Performance Findings – Review of Execution Plans and Index Recommendations,

We have identified an issue related to alerts, where some users, upon opening an alert from the summary page, are redirected to a different alert with a different subject.
After conducting our assessment, we found that certain jobs are creating alerts manually without updating the **ID_LIST** table. This results in multiple alerts being created with the same **alertId**, which causes the incorrect redirection behavior.
One of the identified jobs was the job that are delivered to us with the name **""Doc Expiry Check and Send Alert""**, and the related stored procedure involved in this issue is **BNI_ALERT_INFO_GEN_ID**.
Based on our findings, this issue has been confirmed for the above job, and it is possible that there are other jobs or stored procedures that are generating alerts in a similar manner.
In this regard, we kindly request your assistance to:
1. Perform an assessment to identify any other jobs or stored procedures that may be creating alerts without properly updating the **ID_LIST** table.
2. Provide guidance or a resolution approach to prevent duplicate alert ID generation and avoid similar issues going forward.

Observation: When an agent initiates a call from the Ameyo toolbar, the main HDFC Securities CRM page automatically refreshes. This causes the Ameyo toolbar (running inside an iframe) to reload, disrupting the agent workflow and impacting productivity.



Exotel Response & Analysis:
The issue originates from client-side scripting within the HDFC Securities CRM application, not from the Ameyo system.
The CRM page uses a script (ameyoLogin.js) that includes the function initialiseAmeyoLogin, which dynamically loads the Ameyo iframe.
When the CRM page refreshes, the script is executed again, matching the behavior reported (“the third-party CRM is initializing the login page after call”).
The CRM application contains an unnecessary event listener that is incorrectly monitoring actions within the Ameyo iframe and triggering a full page reload when a call is initiated.



Conclusion: The root cause is related to the CRMNext page logic, which is refreshing unnecessarily and reloading the toolbar.",Update on Reported Issues Related to Toolbar Integration Panel | HSL,
